WhatsApp Integration (Optional)
===============================

Mutases provides optional WhatsApp notification support using
a background worker and helper function.

WA Worker Setup
---------------

Create a file named ``wa_worker.php`` in the **root Mutases folder**:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php

   $queue_file = __DIR__ . "/wa_queue.txt";

   while (true) {

       if (!file_exists($queue_file)) {
           sleep(1);
           continue;
       }

       $lines = file($queue_file, FILE_IGNORE_NEW_LINES | FILE_SKIP_EMPTY_LINES);
       file_put_contents($queue_file, ""); // clear queue

       foreach ($lines as $line) {
           $data = json_decode($line, true);

           // WhatsApp server configuration
           $url   = "YOUR_WA_SERVER_URL";
           $token = "YOUR_API_TOKEN";

           $payload = json_encode([
               "number"  => $data['number'],
               "message" => $data['message']
           ]);

           $ch = curl_init($url);
           curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
               "Content-Type: application/json",
               "token: " . $token
           ]);
           curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
           curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $payload);
           curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
           curl_exec($ch);
           curl_close($ch);
       }

       sleep(2); // check queue every 2 seconds
   }

WA Helper Setup
---------------

Create a helper file at ``application/helpers/wa_helper.php``:

.. code-block:: php

   <?php if (!defined('BASEPATH')) exit('No direct script access allowed');

   function send_wa($number, $message)
   {
       $url   = "YOUR_WA_SERVER_URL";
       $token = "YOUR_API_TOKEN";

       $data = [
           "number"  => $number,
           "message" => $message
       ];

       $payload = json_encode($data);

       $ch = curl_init($url);
       curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
           "Content-Type: application/json",
           "token: " . $token
       ]);
       curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
       curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $payload);
       curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

       $result = curl_exec($ch);
       curl_close($ch);

       return $result;
   }

.. warning::

   Make sure ``wa_worker.php`` and ``wa_helper.php`` are excluded from
   version control if they contain sensitive credentials
   (API tokens, server URLs).
